## ✨ Scripts

### [Better Sprite Sheet Export](./Better%20Sprite%20Sheet%20Export.lua)

This script will flatten the groups of layers and then export a sprite sheet.

This is useful if you work with several groups of layers but you want each group to be a single layer when exporting.

You can choose to export only the visible layers or all of them (they will be automatically made visible).

***No changes are made to your sprites.***
